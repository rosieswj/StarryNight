# StarryNight

***PROJECT OVERVIEW***
This program is an interactive animation program which combines game and drawing experience, using 3d graphic module Processing. It has 2 implementations that create a complete UI:

1. the first part is an interactive animation that combines jigsaw puzzle game with the 3D animation, in which the famous artwork by Van Goph is animated 
2. a painting interface that can detect colors, stroke weights, lines, dots and motions, and animate accordingly. It also includes features to save artwork and erase.
